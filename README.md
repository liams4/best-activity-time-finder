# best-activity-time-finder
## About the program
This program prompts a user to input an activity and the nearest city to where they plan to do the activity. It then pulls weather forecast data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) for the city and suggests the best time in the near future to do the activity based on temperature and weather conditions. It also shows a basic plot of the temperature forecast to the user.
