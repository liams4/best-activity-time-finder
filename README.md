# best-activity-time-finder
## About the program
This program prompts a user to input an activity and the nearest city to where they plan to do the activity. It then pulls weather forecast data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) for the city and suggests the best time in the near future to do the activity based on temperature and weather conditions. It also shows a basic plot of the temperature forecast to the user.

## To run
2 API Keys and 4 Java libraries are required to run this program: the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and the [Google Geocode API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) are the APIs, and [HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/index.html), [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/), [JCommon](http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/), and [JSONJava](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) are the libraries. The OpenWeather API is free to use and the Geocode API is free if you don't use more than $200 worth of credit per month (which would require many, many API calls). After cloning the repository, add the _.jar_ files of the libraries mentioned above to the project's classpath and change the paths from which the API keys are read to your personal API Key paths (in _WeatherForecast.java_). You will now be able to run BestActivityTimeFinder.java!
